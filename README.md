# You have 3 days until Mario steals your liver

Running isn't an option.

You have 3 days to live.

The classic meme recreated and expanded in Godot!

# v1.0.1b

Same as v1.0.1a, but countdown timer is only 5 minutes.

A better version if you want Mario to steal your liver faster.

# v1.0.1a

Added an authentic 3 day countdown until Mario steals your liver.

Took away ability to close application.

When pressing ok, application minimizes Mario to your system tray.

After 24 real-time hours Mario will pop-up, saying you now only have 2 days until he steals your liver.

Mario will continue counting down every 24 hours until day 0.

After that, I don't know what happens.

# v1.0.0

First release of Mario Steals You Liver In Godot!

No countdown timer.

Can close application immediately.
