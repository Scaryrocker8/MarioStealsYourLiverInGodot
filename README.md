# You have 3 days until Mario steals your liver

Running is not an option.

You have 3 days to live.

The classic meme recreated and expanded in Godot!

# v1.0.0

First release of Mario Steals You Liver In Godot!

# v1.0.1

Added an authentic 3 day countdown until Mario steals your liver!

When closing the application, it minimizes Mario to your system tray.

In 24 hours after application has started Mario will reappear, saying you now only have 2 days until he steals your liver.

Mario will continue counting down each day until day 0.

After that, I don't know what happens.
