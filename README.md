# You have 3 days until Mario steals your liver

Running isn't an option.

You have 3 days to live.

The classic meme recreated and expanded in Godot!

# v1.0.1

Added an authentic 3 day countdown until Mario steals your liver.

Took away ability to close application.

When pressing ok, application minimizes Mario to your system tray.

In 24 real-time hours after application has started Mario will reappear, saying you now only have 2 days until he steals your liver.

Mario will continue counting down every 24 hours until day 0.

After that, I don't know what happens.

# v1.0.0

First release of Mario Steals You Liver In Godot!
